# Olist E-Commerce Strategy Consulting Project

## Overview
This project applies a strategy consulting approach to Olist, a leading Brazilian e-commerce marketplace.  
The goal is to extract insights from real-world Kaggle data and translate them into strategic recommendations that support growth, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

It combines:
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaning, structuring, and analyzing Olist’s datasets (orders, customers, payments, reviews, logistics).  
- **Visualization**: Clear, professional graphs to highlight business KPIs.  
- **Consulting Mindset**: Turning analytics into actionable recommendations for decision-makers.  
- **Presentation**: A client-ready PowerPoint deck that summarizes the findings and strategy.
